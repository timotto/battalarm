<h1 i18n>Installation</h1>
<p i18n>You need install the adapter in your vehicle and the base station in your garage.</p>
<h2 i18n>Vehicle adapter</h2>

                     [class]="imageClass"></app-image-thumbnail>
<p i18n>The adapter has a standard vehicle power connector. It also has a standard vehicle power socket, so you can use other electric devices without unplugging the adapter.</p>
<p i18n>Mount it on your vehicle using velcro tape to make sure it does not flap around.</p>
<h2 i18n>Base station</h2>
<app-image-thumbnail src="assets/base_station_4x3_1280.jpg"
                     srcThumb="assets/base_station_4x3_320.jpg"
                     alt="image of the base station" i18n-alt
                     [class]="imageClass"></app-image-thumbnail>
<p i18n>Mount the base station inside your garage.</p>
<p i18n>Keep it away from the gate so the adapter has a stronger signal when the vehicle is inside the garage. Otherwise the adapter might wrongly assume the vehicle to be in the garage when in fact it is parked outside in front of it.</p>
