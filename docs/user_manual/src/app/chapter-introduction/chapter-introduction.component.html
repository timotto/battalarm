<h1 i18n>Introduction</h1>
<p i18n>The Battery Alarm adapter is meant to solve a specific problem.</p>
<p i18n>We all know it and it has happened to everybody: you pick up your phone on your way out and the battery is almost dead because we forgot to plug it in.</p>
<p i18n>The same can happen to power hungry vehicles: you receive an alert, jump into your truck and the starter doesn't even budge because you forgot to plug in the charging cable after your previous trip.</p>
<p i18n>This User's Manual contains all the information to get you started. See the chapters for details:</p>
