<h1 i18n>Configuration</h1>
<p i18n>There's a smartphone app to configure the adapter.</p>
<p i18n>With the app you can configure a bunch of parameters, like the duration until the adapter sounds the warning or the alert tone, the voltage of your battery charger, or the signal strength of the base station when the vehicle is in the garage.</p>
<p i18n>Usually configuration is a one time job, or at least it's just necessary for a few times after installing the adapter and the base station.</p>
<h2 i18n>Getting the app</h2>
<p i18n>You can download the Android app from Google Play.</p>

<p i18n>To install the iPhone app you need a Mac computer and build and install it on your own. I neither have an iPhone nor do I pay the annual fee to Apple to be able to publish iPhone apps.</p>
